# R4GoodPersonalFinances 0.2.0

This release provides functions for calculating probability of retirement ruin and functions for calibrating the underlying Gompertz model with the use of the mortality rates.

## Major changes

* Added `calc_retirement_ruin()` and `plot_retirement_ruin()` to calculate and visualize the probability of retirement ruin.
* Added `retirement-ruin` option to `run_app()` function for
running package new interactive app.
* Added `calc_gompertz_survival_probability()` to calculate the probability of survival using the Gompertz model. 
* Added `calc_gompertz_parameters()` to calculate the parameters of the Gompertz model based on mortality rates and `calc_gompertz_joint_parameters()` to calculate the parameters of the joint Gompertz model.
* Added `plot_gompertz_calibration()` for visually checking the calibration of the Gompertz model and `plot_joint_survival()` for plotting the survival probabilities for two individuals and their joint survival probability.
* Added `read_hmd_life_tables()` for reading the 'Human Mortality Database' (HMD) life tables files.

Initial release of the package includes functions designed to 
support the optimal allocation of your investment portfolio
with the use of the 'Merton Share' formula.

* Added `calc_purchasing_power()` and `plot_purchasing_power()` to calculate and visualize the effect of real interest rates—whether positive (compounding) or negative (inflation)—on the purchasing power of savings.  
* Added `calc_optimal_risky_asset_allocation()` for calculating optimal allocation using the 'Merton Share' formula.  
* Added `calc_risk_adjusted_return()` and `plot_risk_adjusted_returns()` to calculate and visualize the effect of allocation to risky assets on the risk-adjusted return.
* Added `run_app()` function that runs package interactive apps:
`risk-adjusted-returns` and `purchasing-power`.
